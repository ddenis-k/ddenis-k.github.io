Dancing at Lughnasa	March 15, 2024 - March 31, 2024	The City Theatre	This extraordinary poetic drama, Dancing at Lughnasa is the story of five unmarried Irish sisters eking out their lives in a small village in 1936.

Widely regarded as Brian Friel’s masterpiece, Lughnasa is a haunting and poetic tribute to the spirit and valor of the past.
Cory Morrow	March 21, 2024	The 04 Center	Cory Morrow's record is an aggressive blend of early Morrow sound with a current day perspective. Vintage feel from an evolving heart and mind. The title track, “Whiskey & Pride” features the age-old struggle of love versus ego and cleverly straddles the line of sermon and self-deprecation. The twist comes in the form of a mirror behind a bar that reveals the true identity of the accuser. The track, which is also the first single release, features the Texas Country-style instrumentation prevalent in Morrow’s early days, including steel guitar phenom and producer of “Whiskey & Pride”, Lloyd Maines.  If the new record, and this phase of Morrow’s career, had to be summed up in one word – the word would be “real”. As evidenced by his latest recordings, live shows, and online communication with fans, he’s not pandering, he’s simply doing what he knows. Pulling back the curtains, letting us in, and letting the chips fall where they may.  “Whiskey & Pride” is much more than a collection of songs. It’s another mile-marker in the journey of Cory Morrow.
Bridging with Mother	March 21, 2024 - March 23, 2024	The Vortex	Tyagaraja Welch of Sustainable Humane Earth Productions (SHE Produces) presents his latest singular art experience, Bridging with Mother, at The VORTEX, March 21-23, 2024. TICKETS ABOUT THE SHOW  Bridging with Mother is an artistic call to “conjoin,” to “merge,” or to “become one with nature.” Experience live music, classical Indian dance, multimedia art, acting, and stage design created by Tyagaraja Welch and directed by his partner Gunjen Mittal. Bridging with Mother is the culmination of classical Indian art forms and permaculture theory, inspired by the Sanskrit term for yoga. It is a production of Welch’s original music, the first release since the pre-pandemic production of VIVEKA, by Welch’s assemblage Light Wheel.  Tyaga Welch offers these words on the project:  “What are we, and where did we come from? When one comes to a mighty waterfall, or stands at the edge of the world along a vast coastal ocean, or bathes in a sacred river, what is the first organic response? When this question is presented in our Yogic Workshops, ninety percent of the participants answer with not a word; they answer with a sound: ‘Aaaahhh.’ This ‘ah’ sound of relief has the hidden answer to all human dilemma. If we are mindful and connected with experiencing our present moment, the ‘aaaahhh’ sound is an ‘aha’ moment, the moment of awakening. The deeper one goes into the topic, the more questions arise. What is the ‘aha’ moment? Spirituality, in its purest sense, is remembrance. The reason why your faith or individual spirituality feels so right, pure, and true to you is because it feels familiar––something you always thought and couldn’t quite put your finger on––like the moment when your hand opens the door to your own house. You feel at peace, safe, and familiar with the surroundings.”  “It’s in times like these that shows like Bridging with Mother are so important to produce because art can promote a paradigm shift towards compassion and action. If you attend the live show at The VORTEX, you will be moved,” says Gunjen Mittal, Director of Bridging with Mother.  Bridging with Mother will be a show for everyone. With the additions of Gunjen Mittal, Welch’s eight-year-old daughter, and elders as advisors, the show’s collaborators span an age range of seventy years. It is an opportunity for the Austin community to support the production of heritage art and live music.

Through images of Black women embracing vibrant colors and confidently wearing shades of red lipstick, Leta's bold photographic prints showcase women using beauty as a form of activism to reclaim their power, challenge oppressive beauty standards, and stifle stereotypes. Leta’s powerful images celebrate each woman’s uniqueness, fostering self-love, promoting positive change, and illustrating Black women breaking free from the shackles of conformity.  About the Artist Leta Harrison is a local Austin photographer with an unwavering passion for capturing the essence of her subjects and telling their powerful stories through her lens. Drawing inspiration from Texas musician, Kam Franklin's artist talk, in which she bravely shared her personal experiences of facing pressure to be more modest and being judged for her expressive style, often considered "too much", Kam's poignant recollection of the phrase, "Black girls don't wear red lipstick," struck a chord with Leta, inspiring her to further uplift the women that she photographs and to create this exhibition.

poolboy: don't pick up	March 21, 2024 - March 23, 2024	The Museum of Human Achievement	"poolboy: don’t pick up" is a queer immersive party and performance about submissiveness, friendship, and failure. Your computer is whitehot in your lap. What happens next is entirely in your control.  poolboy is trying to write a murder mystery. His best friend, momgrab (artist Julia Mounsey), is ghosting him. To avoid writing, poolboy will do anything you say. Anything. "don’t pick up" seems simple, an excavation of 20 years of writing: from School of Rock fanfic to failed plays to abandoned journals. The audience freely interrupts with questions, new conversation topics, or by giving poolboy tasks to complete on the spot. Reality and fiction intertwine. All is not what it seems. "poolboy: don’t pick up" is pure chaos: a participatory, living, white-knuckle document of poolboy’s very real life.  This project is supported in part by the City of Austin Economic Development Department.

Author Talk and Signing:Parker Adams, 'The Lock Box'	March 22, 2024	BookPeople	Free and open to the public! BookPeople welcomes Parker Adams, in-conversation with Meg Gardiner, to celebrate the release of his new heist thriller, The Lock Box! Books will be available for sale and signing at the end of the event.  About the book: When an army-vet-turned-safecracker is forcibly recruited to be part of a dangerous heist, she’ll need all her skills to get out alive in this fast-paced thriller perfect for fans of Jeffery Deaver and P. J. Tracy.  Nearly a decade after getting chased out of the Army for fighting back against abuse, Monna Locke’s skill and discretion have made her the go-to safecracker for Los Angeles clients who need vaults opened and no questions asked. When a lawyer hires her to retrieve a box from his client’s mansion, it seems like an easy payday—until she opens the safe and is immediately attacked by heavily-armed men.  Locke barely escapes and returns to her isolated cabin only to find the client waiting in her home, threatening what she holds most dear: her son, Evan. After being knocked unconscious, she wakes up across the country, trapped in her own personal nightmare: she and Evan will be held captive until she helps a seedy crew pull off a seemingly impossible heist. Forced to practice breaking into the most impenetrable safe ever designed, Locke bides her time and eyes her escape routes. She knows there’s no way to finish the job she’s been forced into, but it’s either crack the lock, or lose everything.  About the author: The son of a navy helicopter pilot, Parker Adams chased great white sharks as a marine biologist before becoming a patent lawyer who litigates multimillion-dollar cases for high-tech clients. In his spare time, he writes high-stakes thrillers that feature travel and technology, including the best-selling Seth Walker series (as Joseph Reid). A graduate of Duke University and the University of Notre Dame, he lives in San Diego with his wife and children.  About the moderator: Meg Gardiner is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of a number of critically acclaimed novels. Her thrillers have won the Edgar Award and been summer reading picks by the Today show and O, the Oprah Magazine. In August 2022 her novel, Heat 2, coauthored with Michael Mann, debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. A former lawyer and three-time Jeopardy! champion, Gardiner lives in Austin, Texas.
Bayonne with Live Ensemble (Orchestrated)	March 22, 2024	The 04 Center	Emerging from the shared experience of losing their fathers, 'Temporary Time (Orchestrated)' is a collaborative project weaving Bayonne's visceral songwriting with Nathaniel Earl's lush orchestral composition. Employing a small chamber orchestra, they have reimagined four of Bayonne's most personal songs and crafted a new piece that encapsulates the emotional journey from grief to hope. Composed during the summer of 2023 at each other’s home studios in Austin, TX, Bayonne and Nathaniel broke down each piece to a stencil foundation, then infused the negative space with vibrant colors of orchestra and synths, yielding a collection more closely resembling a symphonic structure than a traditional album. On March 22nd the two bring their collaboration to the stage at the 04 Center in Austin, TX with Bayonne performing songs new and old for the first time with a live ensemble.

Leta’s powerful images celebrate each woman’s uniqueness, fostering self-love, promoting positive change, and illustrating Black women breaking free from the shackles of conformity.  About the Artist Leta Harrison is a local Austin photographer with an unwavering passion for capturing the essence of her subjects and telling their powerful stories through her lens. Drawing inspiration from Texas musician, Kam Franklin's artist talk, in which she bravely shared her personal experiences of facing pressure to be more modest and being judged for her expressive style, often considered "too much", Kam's poignant recollection of the phrase, "Black girls don't wear red lipstick," struck a chord with Leta, inspiring her to further uplift the women that she photographs and to create this exhibition.

Bridging with Mother	March 21, 2024 - March 23, 2024	The Vortex	Tyagaraja Welch of Sustainable Humane Earth Productions (SHE Produces) presents his latest singular art experience, Bridging with Mother, at The VORTEX, March 21-23, 2024. TICKETS ABOUT THE SHOW  Bridging with Mother is an artistic call to “conjoin,” to “merge,” or to “become one with nature.” Experience live music, classical Indian dance, multimedia art, acting, and stage design created by Tyagaraja Welch and directed by his partner Gunjen Mittal. Bridging with Mother is the culmination of classical Indian art forms and permaculture theory, inspired by the Sanskrit term for yoga. It is a production of Welch’s original music, the first release since the pre-pandemic production of VIVEKA, by Welch’s assemblage Light Wheel.  Tyaga Welch offers these words on the project:  “What are we, and where did we come from? When one comes to a mighty waterfall, or stands at the edge of the world along a vast coastal ocean, or bathes in a sacred river, what is the first organic response? When this question is presented in our Yogic Workshops, ninety percent of the participants answer with not a word; they answer with a sound: ‘Aaaahhh.’ This ‘ah’ sound of relief has the hidden answer to all human dilemma. If we are mindful and connected with experiencing our present moment, the ‘aaaahhh’ sound is an ‘aha’ moment, the moment of awakening. The deeper one goes into the topic, the more questions arise. What is the ‘aha’ moment? Spirituality, in its purest sense, is remembrance. The reason why your faith or individual spirituality feels so right, pure, and true to you is because it feels familiar––something you always thought and couldn’t quite put your finger on––like the moment when your hand opens the door to your own house. You feel at peace, safe, and familiar with the surroundings.”  “It’s in times like these that shows like Bridging with Mother are so important to produce because art can promote a paradigm shift towards compassion and action. If you attend the live show at The VORTEX, you will be moved,” says Gunjen Mittal, Director of Bridging with Mother.  Bridging with Mother will be a show for everyone. With the additions of Gunjen Mittal, Welch’s eight-year-old daughter, and elders as advisors, the show’s collaborators span an age range of seventy years. It is an opportunity for the Austin community to support the production of heritage art and live music.

Two Births and the Afterlife Exhibit	January 11, 2024 - April 20, 2024	George Washington Carver Museum, Cultural & Genealogy Center	Two Births and the Afterlife features a new body of work by Milwaukee-based artist Aimée M. Everett, exploring the profound transformations experienced during childbirth and the subsequent journey of self-discovery into motherhood. The artist delves into the poignant realization that with every birth, there exists a simultaneous death—the departure of one's former identity to welcome a new, evolved self. Everett vividly portrays the overwhelming joy and simultaneous dissolution of familiar aspects of identity. This body of work—employing abstraction, minimalistic line-making, saturated colors, and melodic compositions—serves as an emotional odyssey.    The months following the birth unfolded into a challenging transition period.

poolboy: don't pick up	March 21, 2024 - March 23, 2024	The Museum of Human Achievement	"poolboy: don’t pick up" is a queer immersive party and performance about submissiveness, friendship, and failure. Your computer is whitehot in your lap. What happens next is entirely in your control.  poolboy is trying to write a murder mystery. His best friend, momgrab (artist Julia Mounsey), is ghosting him. To avoid writing, poolboy will do anything you say. Anything. "don’t pick up" seems simple, an excavation of 20 years of writing: from School of Rock fanfic to failed plays to abandoned journals. The audience freely interrupts with questions, new conversation topics, or by giving poolboy tasks to complete on the spot. Reality and fiction intertwine. All is not what it seems. "poolboy: don’t pick up" is pure chaos: a participatory, living, white-knuckle document of poolboy’s very real life.  This project is supported in part by the City of Austin Economic Development Department.

Black Girls Don't Wear Red Lipstick	February 15, 2024 - April 21, 2024	Austin Central Library Gallery (2nd Floor)	Step into a world of audacious beauty and empowerment with the photo exhibition, Black Girls Don't Wear Red Lipstick, created by the visionary photographer, Leta Harrison, curated by Keyheira Keys and Whitney Hamilton, _OFCOLORATX.  Through images of Black women embracing vibrant colors and confidently wearing shades of red lipstick, Leta's bold photographic prints showcase women using beauty as a form of activism to reclaim their power, challenge oppressive beauty standards, and stifle stereotypes. Leta’s powerful images celebrate each woman’s uniqueness, fostering self-love, promoting positive change, and illustrating Black women breaking free from the shackles of conformity.  About the Artist Leta Harrison is a local Austin photographer with an unwavering passion for capturing the essence of her subjects and telling their powerful stories through her lens. Drawing inspiration from Texas musician, Kam Franklin's artist talk, in which she bravely shared her personal experiences of facing pressure to be more modest and being judged for her expressive style, often considered "too much", Kam's poignant recollection of the phrase, "Black girls don't wear red lipstick," struck a chord with Leta, inspiring her to further uplift the women that she photographs and to create this exhibition.

Bridging with Mother	March 21, 2024 - March 23, 2024	The Vortex	Tyagaraja Welch of Sustainable Humane Earth Productions (SHE Produces) presents his latest singular art experience, Bridging with Mother, at The VORTEX, March 21-23, 2024. TICKETS ABOUT THE SHOW  Bridging with Mother is an artistic call to “conjoin,” to “merge,” or to “become one with nature.” Experience live music, classical Indian dance, multimedia art, acting, and stage design created by Tyagaraja Welch and directed by his partner Gunjen Mittal. Bridging with Mother is the culmination of classical Indian art forms and permaculture theory, inspired by the Sanskrit term for yoga. It is a production of Welch’s original music, the first release since the pre-pandemic production of VIVEKA, by Welch’s assemblage Light Wheel.  Tyaga Welch offers these words on the project:  “What are we, and where did we come from? When one comes to a mighty waterfall, or stands at the edge of the world along a vast coastal ocean, or bathes in a sacred river, what is the first organic response? When this question is presented in our Yogic Workshops, ninety percent of the participants answer with not a word; they answer with a sound: ‘Aaaahhh.’ This ‘ah’ sound of relief has the hidden answer to all human dilemma. If we are mindful and connected with experiencing our present moment, the ‘aaaahhh’ sound is an ‘aha’ moment, the moment of awakening. The deeper one goes into the topic, the more questions arise. What is the ‘aha’ moment? Spirituality, in its purest sense, is remembrance. The reason why your faith or individual spirituality feels so right, pure, and true to you is because it feels familiar––something you always thought and couldn’t quite put your finger on––like the moment when your hand opens the door to your own house. You feel at peace, safe, and familiar with the surroundings.”  “It’s in times like these that shows like Bridging with Mother are so important to produce because art can promote a paradigm shift towards compassion and action. If you attend the live show at The VORTEX, you will be moved,” says Gunjen Mittal, Director of Bridging with Mother.  Bridging with Mother will be a show for everyone. With the additions of Gunjen Mittal, Welch’s eight-year-old daughter, and elders as advisors, the show’s collaborators span an age range of seventy years. It is an opportunity for the Austin community to support the production of heritage art and live music.

poolboy: don't pick up	March 21, 2024 - March 23, 2024	The Museum of Human Achievement	"poolboy: don’t pick up" is a queer immersive party and performance about submissiveness, friendship, and failure. Your computer is whitehot in your lap. What happens next is entirely in your control.  poolboy is trying to write a murder mystery. His best friend, momgrab (artist Julia Mounsey), is ghosting him. To avoid writing, poolboy will do anything you say. Anything. "don’t pick up" seems simple, an excavation of 20 years of writing: from School of Rock fanfic to failed plays to abandoned journals. The audience freely interrupts with questions, new conversation topics, or by giving poolboy tasks to complete on the spot. Reality and fiction intertwine. All is not what it seems. "poolboy: don’t pick up" is pure chaos: a participatory, living, white-knuckle document of poolboy’s very real life.  This project is supported in part by the City of Austin Economic Development Department.

"Borderless: Together Outside" A Panel Discussion with New Public Artwork	March 24, 2024	Dimension Gallery Sculpture Park	The Borderless: Together Outside series kicks off with a panel discussion led by Paloma Mayorga and artwork by Darcie Book. Mayorga will moderate a conversation about human relationships to nature and landscape with panelists Jamal Hussain, Kill Joy, and Mueni Loko Rudd, taking place on Sunday March 24th, 6:00 – 8:00 PM at Dimension Gallery Sculpture Park. The conversation coincides with The Land Stares Back, an interactive art intervention by Darcie Book. Please bring your picnic blankets and pillows for lawn seating. Limited chair seating will be available for those who need it.  The Borderless: Together Outside series addresses topics at the intersection of art and environmentalism, led by Austin's LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, and refugee communities. Some of our most vulnerable populations feel unsafe and unwelcome in our shared outdoor spaces, and are therefore less likely to experience the joy and major health benefits of time spent in nature. Our goal is to make change in this area through the ongoing community series, and other collaborative efforts. The project's background is aligned with the artistic practice of founder, Darcie Book, as it considers our complex human relationship with the land. The idea is that we look into a landscape and the land looks right back at us. The land is aware. It is alive, and it sees us.  This project is supported in part by the City of Austin Economic Development Department and made possible by our generous hosts at Dimension Gallery Sculpture Park, Colin McIntyre and Moya McIntyre.  "Borderless: Together Outside" A conversation about human relationships to nature and landscape Panel Discussion: Sunday, March 24, 6PM - 8PM Related artwork on view 24/7 beginning: March 24

Drawing inspiration from Texas musician, Kam Franklin's artist talk, in which she bravely shared her personal experiences of facing pressure to be more modest and being judged for her expressive style, often considered "too much", Kam's poignant recollection of the phrase, "Black girls don't wear red lipstick," struck a chord with Leta, inspiring her to further uplift the women that she photographs and to create this exhibition.

About the Artist Leta Harrison is a local Austin photographer with an unwavering passion for capturing the essence of her subjects and telling their powerful stories through her lens. Drawing inspiration from Texas musician, Kam Franklin's artist talk, in which she bravely shared her personal experiences of facing pressure to be more modest and being judged for her expressive style, often considered "too much", Kam's poignant recollection of the phrase, "Black girls don't wear red lipstick," struck a chord with Leta, inspiring her to further uplift the women that she photographs and to create this exhibition.

Ditte Sørensen: Threads, the Elusive &amp; Feminine	March 28, 2024 - June 2, 2024	Unchained.Art Contemporary Gallery	Threads, the Elusive & Feminine, the first US solo exhibition by Copenhagen-based Danish artist Ditte Sørensen, invites you to dive deeply into the heart of collage innovation. Known as Madstitch, her solo debut unveils the intricate world of fabric as the canvas itself, offering a profound exploration of both the tactile and intangible aspects of various mediums serving as a basis for her work.  Celebrated for her unique fusion of traditional textile techniques with a bold contemporary vision, Sørensen creates narratives that resonate deeply on personal and universal levels. Her work, characterized by an expressive, unpolished sensuality, serves as an invitation to explore the layers of human experience through the lens of fabric and collage art. Sørensen intricately balances and weaves raw narratives, touching upon the delicate intersections of identity, memory, and the essence of femininity.  The exhibition showcases an array of Sørensen's creations, including original fabric artworks, original mixed media pieces and prints. Each piece is a testament to her journey as an artist and a pioneer in the Danish art scene. Her distinctive use of freehand embroidery transforms ordinary elements into storied tapestries that speak to the viewer on multiple levels, sometimes incorporating auditory elements to deepen the sensory experience and immersion. (Follow the hidden QR codes).  At the core of Sørensen's work is an adventurous spirit, captured through her experimental approach to textiles, paper, and water-soluble fabrics on an old sewing machine. Her art is a nuanced exploration that pays acute attention to materials and detail, capturing the essence of the elusive and feminine with a subtlety that is both captivating and tactile. Her work evolved from utilizing predominantly textiles in the past to nowadays mostly paper-based techniques, which can include books, magazines, and chocolate wrappers. Sørensen does not limit herself and explores literally any material from plastic bags, dried leaves, and old pillows as basis for her distinct collages.  Immersive, expressive, distinctive, her art represents a seamless fusion of form, texture, and color, inviting us to experience the intricate world of Ditte Sørensen, where every thread weaves a narrative of the elusive and feminine, challenging us to see beyond the surface and into the depths of collaged storytelling.  opening reception: March 28 | 5 – 8pm kom mød Ditte: March 29 | 5 – 8pm coffee & snacks with Ditte: March 31 | 11 – 2pm (RSVP required - Eventbrite) third thursday: April 18 | 6 – 9pm closing event: June 1st | 5 – 8pm

Leta’s powerful images celebrate each woman’s uniqueness, fostering self-love, promoting positive change, and illustrating Black women breaking free from the shackles of conformity.  About the Artist Leta Harrison is a local Austin photographer with an unwavering passion for capturing the essence of her subjects and telling their powerful stories through her lens. Drawing inspiration from Texas musician, Kam Franklin's artist talk, in which she bravely shared her personal experiences of facing pressure to be more modest and being judged for her expressive style, often considered "too much", Kam's poignant recollection of the phrase, "Black girls don't wear red lipstick," struck a chord with Leta, inspiring her to further uplift the women that she photographs and to create this exhibition.

Ditte Sørensen: Threads, the Elusive &amp; Feminine	March 28, 2024 - June 2, 2024	Unchained.Art Contemporary Gallery	Threads, the Elusive & Feminine, the first US solo exhibition by Copenhagen-based Danish artist Ditte Sørensen, invites you to dive deeply into the heart of collage innovation. Known as Madstitch, her solo debut unveils the intricate world of fabric as the canvas itself, offering a profound exploration of both the tactile and intangible aspects of various mediums serving as a basis for her work.  Celebrated for her unique fusion of traditional textile techniques with a bold contemporary vision, Sørensen creates narratives that resonate deeply on personal and universal levels. Her work, characterized by an expressive, unpolished sensuality, serves as an invitation to explore the layers of human experience through the lens of fabric and collage art. Sørensen intricately balances and weaves raw narratives, touching upon the delicate intersections of identity, memory, and the essence of femininity.  The exhibition showcases an array of Sørensen's creations, including original fabric artworks, original mixed media pieces and prints. Each piece is a testament to her journey as an artist and a pioneer in the Danish art scene. Her distinctive use of freehand embroidery transforms ordinary elements into storied tapestries that speak to the viewer on multiple levels, sometimes incorporating auditory elements to deepen the sensory experience and immersion. (Follow the hidden QR codes).  At the core of Sørensen's work is an adventurous spirit, captured through her experimental approach to textiles, paper, and water-soluble fabrics on an old sewing machine. Her art is a nuanced exploration that pays acute attention to materials and detail, capturing the essence of the elusive and feminine with a subtlety that is both captivating and tactile. Her work evolved from utilizing predominantly textiles in the past to nowadays mostly paper-based techniques, which can include books, magazines, and chocolate wrappers. Sørensen does not limit herself and explores literally any material from plastic bags, dried leaves, and old pillows as basis for her distinct collages.  Immersive, expressive, distinctive, her art represents a seamless fusion of form, texture, and color, inviting us to experience the intricate world of Ditte Sørensen, where every thread weaves a narrative of the elusive and feminine, challenging us to see beyond the surface and into the depths of collaged storytelling.  opening reception: March 28 | 5 – 8pm kom mød Ditte: March 29 | 5 – 8pm coffee & snacks with Ditte: March 31 | 11 – 2pm (RSVP required - Eventbrite) third thursday: April 18 | 6 – 9pm closing event: June 1st | 5 – 8pm

Known as Madstitch, her solo debut unveils the intricate world of fabric as the canvas itself, offering a profound exploration of both the tactile and intangible aspects of various mediums serving as a basis for her work.  Celebrated for her unique fusion of traditional textile techniques with a bold contemporary vision, Sørensen creates narratives that resonate deeply on personal and universal levels. Her work, characterized by an expressive, unpolished sensuality, serves as an invitation to explore the layers of human experience through the lens of fabric and collage art. Sørensen intricately balances and weaves raw narratives, touching upon the delicate intersections of identity, memory, and the essence of femininity.  The exhibition showcases an array of Sørensen's creations, including original fabric artworks, original mixed media pieces and prints. Each piece is a testament to her journey as an artist and a pioneer in the Danish art scene. Her distinctive use of freehand embroidery transforms ordinary elements into storied tapestries that speak to the viewer on multiple levels, sometimes incorporating auditory elements to deepen the sensory experience and immersion. (Follow the hidden QR codes).  At the core of Sørensen's work is an adventurous spirit, captured through her experimental approach to textiles, paper, and water-soluble fabrics on an old sewing machine. Her art is a nuanced exploration that pays acute attention to materials and detail, capturing the essence of the elusive and feminine with a subtlety that is both captivating and tactile. Her work evolved from utilizing predominantly textiles in the past to nowadays mostly paper-based techniques, which can include books, magazines, and chocolate wrappers. Sørensen does not limit herself and explores literally any material from plastic bags, dried leaves, and old pillows as basis for her distinct collages.  Immersive, expressive, distinctive, her art represents a seamless fusion of form, texture, and color, inviting us to experience the intricate world of Ditte Sørensen, where every thread weaves a narrative of the elusive and feminine, challenging us to see beyond the surface and into the depths of collaged storytelling.  opening reception: March 28 | 5 – 8pm kom mød Ditte: March 29 | 5 – 8pm coffee & snacks with Ditte: March 31 | 11 – 2pm (RSVP required - Eventbrite) third thursday: April 18 | 6 – 9pm closing event: June 1st | 5 – 8pm

APOTHEOSIS Art Talk with Kathy McCarty and David Thornberry	March 31, 2024	Lydia Street Gallery	One of Austin’s creative couples is back for their exhibition, appropriately titled, “Apotheosis” as they are certainly at their peaks.

The title also references Kathy’s upcoming album, which she will perform during the reception. Join us in celebrating these originals at their best!

Ditte Sørensen: Threads, the Elusive &amp; Feminine	March 28, 2024 - June 2, 2024	Unchained.Art Contemporary Gallery	Threads, the Elusive & Feminine, the first US solo exhibition by Copenhagen-based Danish artist Ditte Sørensen, invites you to dive deeply into the heart of collage innovation. Known as Madstitch, her solo debut unveils the intricate world of fabric as the canvas itself, offering a profound exploration of both the tactile and intangible aspects of various mediums serving as a basis for her work.  Celebrated for her unique fusion of traditional textile techniques with a bold contemporary vision, Sørensen creates narratives that resonate deeply on personal and universal levels. Her work, characterized by an expressive, unpolished sensuality, serves as an invitation to explore the layers of human experience through the lens of fabric and collage art. Sørensen intricately balances and weaves raw narratives, touching upon the delicate intersections of identity, memory, and the essence of femininity.  The exhibition showcases an array of Sørensen's creations, including original fabric artworks, original mixed media pieces and prints. Each piece is a testament to her journey as an artist and a pioneer in the Danish art scene. Her distinctive use of freehand embroidery transforms ordinary elements into storied tapestries that speak to the viewer on multiple levels, sometimes incorporating auditory elements to deepen the sensory experience and immersion. (Follow the hidden QR codes).  At the core of Sørensen's work is an adventurous spirit, captured through her experimental approach to textiles, paper, and water-soluble fabrics on an old sewing machine. Her art is a nuanced exploration that pays acute attention to materials and detail, capturing the essence of the elusive and feminine with a subtlety that is both captivating and tactile. Her work evolved from utilizing predominantly textiles in the past to nowadays mostly paper-based techniques, which can include books, magazines, and chocolate wrappers. Sørensen does not limit herself and explores literally any material from plastic bags, dried leaves, and old pillows as basis for her distinct collages.  Immersive, expressive, distinctive, her art represents a seamless fusion of form, texture, and color, inviting us to experience the intricate world of Ditte Sørensen, where every thread weaves a narrative of the elusive and feminine, challenging us to see beyond the surface and into the depths of collaged storytelling.  opening reception: March 28 | 5 – 8pm kom mød Ditte: March 29 | 5 – 8pm coffee & snacks with Ditte: March 31 | 11 – 2pm (RSVP required - Eventbrite) third thursday: April 18 | 6 – 9pm closing event: June 1st | 5 – 8pm

Leta’s powerful images celebrate each woman’s uniqueness, fostering self-love, promoting positive change, and illustrating Black women breaking free from the shackles of conformity.  About the Artist Leta Harrison is a local Austin photographer with an unwavering passion for capturing the essence of her subjects and telling their powerful stories through her lens. Drawing inspiration from Texas musician, Kam Franklin's artist talk, in which she bravely shared her personal experiences of facing pressure to be more modest and being judged for her expressive style, often considered "too much", Kam's poignant recollection of the phrase, "Black girls don't wear red lipstick," struck a chord with Leta, inspiring her to further uplift the women that she photographs and to create this exhibition.

The Secret Sisters	April 5, 2024	The 04 Center	Since their 2010 self-titled debut, The Secret Sisters have brought their spellbinding harmonies to songs that untangle the thorniest aspects of life and love and womanhood. In the making of their new album, Mind, Man, Medicine, Alabama-bred siblings Laura Rogers and Lydia Slagle found their songwriting transformed by a newfound sense of self-reliance and equanimity, threading their lyrics with hard-won insight into the complexities of motherhood, commitment, compassion, and self-preservation in an endlessly chaotic world. Centered on a kaleidoscopic sound that boldly blurs the edges of country-folk, the duo’s fifth full-length ultimately confronts many of modern life’s harshest challenges while leading the listener toward a more open-hearted state of mind.  “In our previous records there was a feeling that we had something to prove, but now we’re leaning toward a place of peaceful acceptance and trying to stay immersed in the present,” says Slagle, noting that their shared experience in parenting young children greatly informed that shift in perspective. “There are definitely still moments of frustration and anger on this album, but there’s also a little more light,” Rogers adds. “I think a lot of that came from getting older, and from letting go of the pressure we put on ourselves in the past. We finally reached the point of saying, ‘Let’s just write the songs honestly as we can, and trust that they’ll reach whoever they’re meant to reach.’”  The follow-up to Saturn Return—their 2020 Grammy-nominated LP co-produced by Brandi Carlile and lavishly praised by the likes of Rolling Stone—Mind, Man, Medicine finds The Secret Sisters co-producing alongside Ben Tanner (Alabama Shakes, St. Paul & the Broken Bones) and John Paul White (formerly of Grammy-winning duo the Civil Wars). “On Saturn Return we’d gotten much more confident as far as directing the sound of the record and knowing how to capture our voices in the most honest way, so it felt like the right time for our first foray into production,” says Rogers. The latest in a series of critically lauded releases, the album came to life at FAME Studios (the historic spot in their hometown of Muscle Shoals) and at Sun Drop Sound in nearby Florence, with contributions from such esteemed musicians as Alabama Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell and legendary multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell (Paul Simon, Willie Nelson, Levon Helm).

Ditte Sørensen: Threads, the Elusive &amp; Feminine	March 28, 2024 - June 2, 2024	Unchained.Art Contemporary Gallery	Threads, the Elusive & Feminine, the first US solo exhibition by Copenhagen-based Danish artist Ditte Sørensen, invites you to dive deeply into the heart of collage innovation. Known as Madstitch, her solo debut unveils the intricate world of fabric as the canvas itself, offering a profound exploration of both the tactile and intangible aspects of various mediums serving as a basis for her work.  Celebrated for her unique fusion of traditional textile techniques with a bold contemporary vision, Sørensen creates narratives that resonate deeply on personal and universal levels. Her work, characterized by an expressive, unpolished sensuality, serves as an invitation to explore the layers of human experience through the lens of fabric and collage art. Sørensen intricately balances and weaves raw narratives, touching upon the delicate intersections of identity, memory, and the essence of femininity.  The exhibition showcases an array of Sørensen's creations, including original fabric artworks, original mixed media pieces and prints. Each piece is a testament to her journey as an artist and a pioneer in the Danish art scene. Her distinctive use of freehand embroidery transforms ordinary elements into storied tapestries that speak to the viewer on multiple levels, sometimes incorporating auditory elements to deepen the sensory experience and immersion. (Follow the hidden QR codes).  At the core of Sørensen's work is an adventurous spirit, captured through her experimental approach to textiles, paper, and water-soluble fabrics on an old sewing machine. Her art is a nuanced exploration that pays acute attention to materials and detail, capturing the essence of the elusive and feminine with a subtlety that is both captivating and tactile. Her work evolved from utilizing predominantly textiles in the past to nowadays mostly paper-based techniques, which can include books, magazines, and chocolate wrappers. Sørensen does not limit herself and explores literally any material from plastic bags, dried leaves, and old pillows as basis for her distinct collages.  Immersive, expressive, distinctive, her art represents a seamless fusion of form, texture, and color, inviting us to experience the intricate world of Ditte Sørensen, where every thread weaves a narrative of the elusive and feminine, challenging us to see beyond the surface and into the depths of collaged storytelling.  opening reception: March 28 | 5 – 8pm kom mød Ditte: March 29 | 5 – 8pm coffee & snacks with Ditte: March 31 | 11 – 2pm (RSVP required - Eventbrite) third thursday: April 18 | 6 – 9pm closing event: June 1st | 5 – 8pm

GEORGE WALLACE	April 5, 2024 - April 6, 2024	Cap City Comedy Club	By the age of six, George Wallace knew he wanted to be a comedian. He always enjoyed making people laugh, but he also knew the importance of an education. He attended the University of Akron, Ohio, and upon graduating with degrees in Transportation, Marketing/Advertising, plus advanced studies in Radio and Television from Columbia School of Broadcasting. Literally, a rags-to-riches story, Wallace went from selling rags to VP of Advertising. Still, his dream of being a comedian had a strong hold on him. Within a week of leaving the advertising field, he began to perform stand-up comedy and was offered a job writing for “The Redd Foxx Show.”  Wallace is currently pursuing dual coursework at the University of Phoenix and DeVry. With his writing and stand-up experience, Wallace began landing television appearances.  Wallace was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2013 Soul Train/Centric Comedy All-Star Awards; and won Best Stand-Up Comedian at the prestigious American Comedy Awards after four consecutive nominations. As a veteran radio personality, he has also made appearances on “The Steve Harvey Morning Show” and is a charter member of “The Tom Joyner Morning Show.” In 2004 Wallace appeared as the headlining star of his own show at The Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas for a 30-day run. Sin City showed its admiration by extending Wallace’s contract indefinitely and nicknaming him “The New Mr. Vegas.” Unlike any other comedy show in Las Vegas, Wallace gave away a number of prizes every night including CDs, DVDs, diamond necklaces, dinner at prestigious restaurants, gourmet chocolates, tropical cruises, and even a new car. He celebrated his 10th Anniversary headlining at the Flamingo in March 2014, and announced he was closing the show to head back out on the road.  Wallace regularly performs in comedy clubs across the country and is an ambassador for the United States government, performing at military bases all over the world.  His first book, "LAFF IT OFF" (Chaite Press) was published in 2014. A tome of life wisdom, humor and insight from a lifetime of observation, the book is in its third printing.  Wallace’s most recognized material is his “I Be Thinkin’” lines and jokes about everything from conversational thoughts to political aspirations. Each show he engages members of the audience in comical banter. If provoked, he might even throw out a few of his signature “Yo Mama” jokes. He shows his gratitude to the audience by signing autographs and taking photos after every show.  PLEASE NOTE: Our Balcony section for main room shows is NOT wheelchair accessible.

Two Births and the Afterlife Exhibit	January 11, 2024 - April 20, 2024	George Washington Carver Museum, Cultural & Genealogy Center	Two Births and the Afterlife features a new body of work by Milwaukee-based artist Aimée M. Everett, exploring the profound transformations experienced during childbirth and the subsequent journey of self-discovery into motherhood. The artist delves into the poignant realization that with every birth, there exists a simultaneous death—the departure of one's former identity to welcome a new, evolved self. Everett vividly portrays the overwhelming joy and simultaneous dissolution of familiar aspects of identity. This body of work—employing abstraction, minimalistic line-making, saturated colors, and melodic compositions—serves as an emotional odyssey.    The months following the birth unfolded into a challenging transition period.

About the Artist Leta Harrison is a local Austin photographer with an unwavering passion for capturing the essence of her subjects and telling their powerful stories through her lens.

Ditte Sørensen: Threads, the Elusive &amp; Feminine	March 28, 2024 - June 2, 2024	Unchained.Art Contemporary Gallery	Threads, the Elusive & Feminine, the first US solo exhibition by Copenhagen-based Danish artist Ditte Sørensen, invites you to dive deeply into the heart of collage innovation. Known as Madstitch, her solo debut unveils the intricate world of fabric as the canvas itself, offering a profound exploration of both the tactile and intangible aspects of various mediums serving as a basis for her work.  Celebrated for her unique fusion of traditional textile techniques with a bold contemporary vision, Sørensen creates narratives that resonate deeply on personal and universal levels. Her work, characterized by an expressive, unpolished sensuality, serves as an invitation to explore the layers of human experience through the lens of fabric and collage art. Sørensen intricately balances and weaves raw narratives, touching upon the delicate intersections of identity, memory, and the essence of femininity.  The exhibition showcases an array of Sørensen's creations, including original fabric artworks, original mixed media pieces and prints. Each piece is a testament to her journey as an artist and a pioneer in the Danish art scene. Her distinctive use of freehand embroidery transforms ordinary elements into storied tapestries that speak to the viewer on multiple levels, sometimes incorporating auditory elements to deepen the sensory experience and immersion. (Follow the hidden QR codes).  At the core of Sørensen's work is an adventurous spirit, captured through her experimental approach to textiles, paper, and water-soluble fabrics on an old sewing machine. Her art is a nuanced exploration that pays acute attention to materials and detail, capturing the essence of the elusive and feminine with a subtlety that is both captivating and tactile. Her work evolved from utilizing predominantly textiles in the past to nowadays mostly paper-based techniques, which can include books, magazines, and chocolate wrappers. Sørensen does not limit herself and explores literally any material from plastic bags, dried leaves, and old pillows as basis for her distinct collages.  Immersive, expressive, distinctive, her art represents a seamless fusion of form, texture, and color, inviting us to experience the intricate world of Ditte Sørensen, where every thread weaves a narrative of the elusive and feminine, challenging us to see beyond the surface and into the depths of collaged storytelling.  opening reception: March 28 | 5 – 8pm kom mød Ditte: March 29 | 5 – 8pm coffee & snacks with Ditte: March 31 | 11 – 2pm (RSVP required - Eventbrite) third thursday: April 18 | 6 – 9pm closing event: June 1st | 5 – 8pm
Darrell Scott and Robbie Fulks	April 7, 2024	The 04 Center	Multi-Instrumentalist and Singer-Songwriter Darrell Scott mines and cultivates the everyday moment, taking the rote, menial, mundane, and allowing it to be surreal, ever poignant, and candidly honest, lilting, blooming, and resonating. The words he fosters allow us to make sense of the world, what is at stake here, and our place in it. And ultimately, Darrell knows the sole truth of life is that love is all that matters, that we don’t always get it right, but that’s the instinctive and requisite circuitous allure of things, why we forever chase it, and why it is held sacred. Darrell Scott comes from a musical family with a father who had him smitten with guitars by the age of 4, alongside a brother who played Jerry Reed style as well.  From there, things only ramped up with literature and poetry endeavors while a student at Tufts University, along with playing his way through life.  This would never change.  Robbie Fulks is a singer, recording artist, instrumentalist, composer, and songwriter. His current release, Bluegrass Vacation on Compass Records, returns him to his bluegrass roots, with a large group of masterful musicians including Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, Justin Moses, Ronnie McCoury, Alison Brown, David Grier, Tim O’Brien, Todd Phillips, John Cowan, Brennen Leigh, Randy Kohrs, Sierra Hull, Stuart Duncan, Shad Cobb, and Chris Eldridge. Across 11 new original songs (and one freewheeling interpretation of the Delmore Brothers), Robbie covers themes like small-town blues, the endurance of childhood memory, inebriation, love, divorce, the role of music in strengthening family bonds, losing a loved one to Alzheimer’s, and bluegrass itself. His most recent release, 2017’s Upland Stories, earned year’s-best recognition from NPR and Rolling Stone among many others, as well as two Grammy® nominations, for folk album and American roots song (“Alabama At Night”).

Steve Hackett	April 7, 2024	Paramount Theatre	Emporium presents AN EVENING WITH STEVE HACKETT GENESIS REVISITED  Doors: 6:30pm Show: 7:30pm  Hot on the heels of his most successful solo tour ever, Steve Hackett announced his Steve Hackett Genesis Revisited - Foxtrot at Fifty + Hackett Highlights tour in 2022. The tour marks the 50th anniversary of the legendary Genesis album Foxtrot which, in 1972, was pivotal in establishing the band as a major force in British rock.  Guitarist Steve Hackett joined Genesis in 1971, making his band debut on the Nursery Cryme album which enjoyed a greater commercial success in Europe than the UK. After extensive touring, the band were encouraged, by audience reactions, to further experiment with ever longer compositions and develop their ability to incorporate strong narratives. This, in turn, allowed frontman Peter Gabriel more opportunity to indulge in the theatrics which helped to raise the band’s profile.  Now, for 2023, Steve brings Foxtrot at Fifty to North America for a string of eagerly awaited dates following the huge selling UK 2022 tour.  “I think Foxtrot was a terrific achievement for Genesis at that time,” says Steve Hackett. “I think there is not one weak track on the album, they all have their strong points and I’m really looking forward to doing the whole album live.”  The promoter will be receiving the purchaser list for this event.

About the Artist Leta Harrison is a local Austin photographer with an unwavering passion for capturing the essence of her subjects and telling their powerful stories through her lens. Drawing inspiration from Texas musician, Kam Franklin's artist talk, in which she bravely shared her personal experiences of facing pressure to be more modest and being judged for her expressive style, often considered "too much", Kam's poignant recollection of the phrase, "Black girls don't wear red lipstick," struck a chord with Leta, inspiring her to further uplift the women that she photographs and to create this exhibition.

Drawing inspiration from Texas musician, Kam Franklin's artist talk, in which she bravely shared her personal experiences of facing pressure to be more modest and being judged for her expressive style, often considered "too much", Kam's poignant recollection of the phrase, "Black girls don't wear red lipstick," struck a chord with Leta, inspiring her to further uplift the women that she photographs and to create this exhibition.

About the Artist Leta Harrison is a local Austin photographer with an unwavering passion for capturing the essence of her subjects and telling their powerful stories through her lens. Drawing inspiration from Texas musician, Kam Franklin's artist talk, in which she bravely shared her personal experiences of facing pressure to be more modest and being judged for her expressive style, often considered "too much", Kam's poignant recollection of the phrase, "Black girls don't wear red lipstick," struck a chord with Leta, inspiring her to further uplift the women that she photographs and to create this exhibition.

Her work, characterized by an expressive, unpolished sensuality, serves as an invitation to explore the layers of human experience through the lens of fabric and collage art.

The exhibition showcases an array of Sørensen's creations, including original fabric artworks, original mixed media pieces and prints. Each piece is a testament to her journey as an artist and a pioneer in the Danish art scene. Her distinctive use of freehand embroidery transforms ordinary elements into storied tapestries that speak to the viewer on multiple levels, sometimes incorporating auditory elements to deepen the sensory experience and immersion. (Follow the hidden QR codes).

Her work evolved from utilizing predominantly textiles in the past to nowadays mostly paper-based techniques, which can include books, magazines, and chocolate wrappers.

Paper Trails	April 6, 2024 - June 1, 2024	Dougherty Arts Center	Bernie Diaz manipulates words and images to create assemblages that redirect and obscure origins. Incorporating historical processes of revision, omission, and embellishment, he creates glyph-like arrangements that seek completeness from fragmentation. His process involves scavenging, cutting, layering, and rearranging materials to achieve a sense of completeness from seemingly unrelated parts informed by his ongoing identity formation as a border-dwelling, queer, Tejano.
Rob Baird Album Preview Show	April 19, 2024	The 04 Center	Born and raised in Memphis, TN, Rob Baird began his career sneaking into juke joints and landing between-set gigs at local clubs before he was old enough to drink. By his early twenties, he’d scored a Nashville publishing deal, but an insatiable desire for creative independence eventually led him to Austin, TX, where he spent the better part of the next decade grinding it out on the road, releasing six critically acclaimed studio albums on his own label and sharing dates with the likes of Jason Isbell, Nathaniel Rateliff, and Billy Joe Shaver. Along the way, he would earn praise everywhere from Rolling Stone to the Wall Street Journal, land songs in TV shows including Yellowstone and Nashville, and rack up nearly 100 million streams across platforms.  Baird’s latest album, Burning In The Stars, is undoubtedly his finest, laying it all on the line with raw, vulnerable reflections on hope and loss, faith and resilience, heartbreak and redemption. The songs are lean and compact, cutting to the quick with surgical precision, and the performances are similarly direct, fueled by earnest, melodic arrangements that call to mind everything from Tom Petty and Bob Seger to Lucinda Williams. The result is a cinematic mix of alt-country intimacy and rock and roll ecstasy that refuses to shy away from pain in its pursuit of growth, a masterfully mature work of lyrical and sonic craftsmanship built around the promise that it’s never too late to become who we’re meant to be.

When a tight-knit circle of married gays and lesbians – comfy in the new mainstream – sees themselves through the eyes of their rakish transgender pal, it’s clear that the march toward progress is anything but unified.

Paper Trails	April 6, 2024 - June 1, 2024	Dougherty Arts Center	Bernie Diaz manipulates words and images to create assemblages that redirect and obscure origins. Incorporating historical processes of revision, omission, and embellishment, he creates glyph-like arrangements that seek completeness from fragmentation. His process involves scavenging, cutting, layering, and rearranging materials to achieve a sense of completeness from seemingly unrelated parts informed by his ongoing identity formation as a border-dwelling, queer, Tejano.
THE BLACK FEMINIST GUIDE TO THE HUMAN BODY	April 12, 2024 - May 4, 2024	The Vortex	The VORTEX and Fusebox Festival proudly present the commissioned world premiere of The Black Feminist Guide to the Human Body, a new choreopoem by award-winning playwright and Black cultural studies scholar Lisa B. Thompson. The show premieres 25 years after the debut of her classic comedy Single Black Female and is dedicated to Thompson’s mentor and friend, the legendary theater director Shirley Jo Finney.  The Black Feminist Guide to the Human Body by Lisa B. Thompson takes place at The VORTEX April 12 through May 4, 2024. “The Black Feminist Guide to the Human Body is my theatrical love letter to Black women and girls,” Thompson explains. “The piece calls for radical self-acceptance and self-compassion and celebrates peace, nurturing, rest, care, freedom, joy, and love. It’s about embracing the ‘soft life’ for Black women, whose labor and dedication has sustained people, communities, and institutions.”  Conceived during Thompson’s 2021 MacDowell artist residency and developed during her 2023-24 Texas Performing Arts and Fusebox artist residency, The Black Feminist Guide to the Human Body meditates on Black women’s experiences from the perspectives of mind, body, and spirit. What makes the piece unique is its focus on middle-aged and older Black women, an often invisible and neglected group, especially by the medical establishment. Thompson also celebrates Black feminist pioneers and icons whose contributions to the arts, culture, politics, and academia transformed the world. The piece culminates in an audience dance party and an invitation for Black women to share their own contributions to Black feminist wisdom.  Lisa B. Thompson’s compelling, poetic storytelling incorporates movement, music, and multimedia design. The new piece features original songs co-written with composers Guthrie P. Ramsey, Jr., and Vince Anthony. Her long-time collaborator, award-winning director Rudy Ramirez, returns to Austin to direct. Groundbreaking dancer, actor, and choreographer Sadé M. Jones serves as both movement director and performer. Critically acclaimed actors Nadine Mozon and Hayley Armstrong complete the professional performance ensemble.

The Floating World: Masterpieces of Edo Japan			On view at the Blanton through June 30, 2024.     Enjoy more than 130 woodblock prints and painted scrolls from one of history’s most vibrant artistic eras.  After centuries of conflict and war, Japan’s Edo period (1603–1868) was a time of peace, stability, and economic growth. Members of the ruling class patronized artists, merchants, entertainers, and courtesans in major cities like Tokyo (then called Edo), Kyoto, and Osaka. Sharing a visual culture and appreciation for the transient pleasures of life, such diverse groups comingled in a metropolitan melting pot known as ukiyo, or “floating world.” There, a new art genre emerged: Ukiyo-e. These “pictures of the floating world” depict the lifestyle, pleasures, and interests of the urban population— from samurais, geishas, and kabuki actors to boat parties, palaces, and lush landscapes.
Hill &amp; Adamson: The Clarkson Stanfield Album			Don't miss this unprecedented exhibition of the Clarkson Stanfield Album, a superb volume of early photographs by the celebrated Scottish partnership of Hill & Adamson. Launching their collaboration in Edinburgh in 1843, the established painter David Octavius Hill (1802–1870) and the young photographer Robert Adamson (1821–1848) combined their aesthetic sensitivity and technical brilliance to produce an unparalleled body of portraits, architectural and landscapes scenes, and pioneering social documents. Their work endures today as one of the earliest sustained explorations of photography as an artform.  In the fall of 1845 Hill & Adamson prepared an album of their finest work, arranging 109 salted paper prints from their calotype negatives into a folio bound in rich purple leather with intricate gold tooling, and sold it to the prominent English marine painter Clarkson Frederick Stanfield (1793–1867). Now known as the Clarkson Stanfield Album, it is one of only a few such unique albums assembled in the years before Adamson's death at age 26.  More than 175 years later the album is undergoing structural repair, providing the first opportunity since 1845 to view several sections at once before conservators return them to the original binding. The exhibition includes 39 salted paper prints from the Clarkson Stanfield Album, as well as examples of Adamson's earliest photographic trials and two of Hill's painted landscapes. The exhibition is drawn entirely from the Gernsheim Collection, acquired by the Ransom Center in 1963.

Week 2: Building Strength & Support  An overview of basic spinal anatomy to explore how to build support from the ground up. We will focus on the feet as the base of support for standing poses and create an awareness of how to position the pelvis over the legs for optimum transmission of force.     Week 3: Aligning the Spine  Refining the theme of the spine as the central column of support for the body, we will introduce the intention of moving with a calm, quiet spine.

Public Works: Art by Elizabeth Olds			Explore the under-told story of Elizabeth Olds (1896–1991), an innovative artist who worked to bring art into the daily lives of more Americans. The first woman to receive the Guggenheim Fellowship for visual arts, Olds became a vital force in the Works Progress Administration and later a celebrated children's book author-illustrator. As a WPA printmaker and educator, she captured the essence of Depression-era America and championed the affordability and accessibility of silkscreen printing. Through her dedication to experimentation, she sought to activate the uniquely democratic possibilities of printmaking and mobilize fine art as an impactful education tool. This exhibition represents the first critically engaged exploration of Olds's extensive body of work, showcasing over 100 prints, paintings, drawings, and illustrations from the 1920s to the 1960s. The exhibition examines Olds's artistic legacy—from her poignant portrayals of labor conditions in American industry, to her satirical social commentary, to her engaging children's books—and underscores the enduring significance of art in everyday life.

Hill &amp; Adamson: The Clarkson Stanfield Album			Don't miss this unprecedented exhibition of the Clarkson Stanfield Album, a superb volume of early photographs by the celebrated Scottish partnership of Hill & Adamson. Launching their collaboration in Edinburgh in 1843, the established painter David Octavius Hill (1802–1870) and the young photographer Robert Adamson (1821–1848) combined their aesthetic sensitivity and technical brilliance to produce an unparalleled body of portraits, architectural and landscapes scenes, and pioneering social documents. Their work endures today as one of the earliest sustained explorations of photography as an artform.  In the fall of 1845 Hill & Adamson prepared an album of their finest work, arranging 109 salted paper prints from their calotype negatives into a folio bound in rich purple leather with intricate gold tooling, and sold it to the prominent English marine painter Clarkson Frederick Stanfield (1793–1867). Now known as the Clarkson Stanfield Album, it is one of only a few such unique albums assembled in the years before Adamson's death at age 26.  More than 175 years later the album is undergoing structural repair, providing the first opportunity since 1845 to view several sections at once before conservators return them to the original binding. The exhibition includes 39 salted paper prints from the Clarkson Stanfield Album, as well as examples of Adamson's earliest photographic trials and two of Hill's painted landscapes. The exhibition is drawn entirely from the Gernsheim Collection, acquired by the Ransom Center in 1963.

The Floating World: Masterpieces of Edo Japan			On view at the Blanton through June 30, 2024.     Enjoy more than 130 woodblock prints and painted scrolls from one of history’s most vibrant artistic eras.  After centuries of conflict and war, Japan’s Edo period (1603–1868) was a time of peace, stability, and economic growth. Members of the ruling class patronized artists, merchants, entertainers, and courtesans in major cities like Tokyo (then called Edo), Kyoto, and Osaka. Sharing a visual culture and appreciation for the transient pleasures of life, such diverse groups comingled in a metropolitan melting pot known as ukiyo, or “floating world.” There, a new art genre emerged: Ukiyo-e. These “pictures of the floating world” depict the lifestyle, pleasures, and interests of the urban population— from samurais, geishas, and kabuki actors to boat parties, palaces, and lush landscapes.

Yoga Renewal Series			Join us for a powerful series to kick-off your practice this year! Are you interested in discovering ways to better support yourself during your existing yoga practice or to try yoga for the first time? This 8-week Yoga Renewal Series is perfect for all levels and recommended for anyone who wants to create a stable foundation for a safe and deepened yoga journey!     In this 8-week series, you can expect to learn:  -How to settle your mind and come into your body, breath, and self more deeply. -How to establish and maintain better posture, both on and off the mat, resulting in greater ease, stability and balance, lower stress, greater stability and balance, and fewer aches and pains. -How to move and breathe naturally and organically. -How to prevent injury or strain and promote longevity in any style of yoga. -About your anatomy, and how to adapt your practice to suit your individual needs and wellness goals with optimal results. -To create and establish your personal yoga practice and integrate yoga into your everyday life and way of being.  Supportive reading assignments are given after class for those interested in taking this study deeper at home.     This series, based on the teachings of Donna Farhi, will cover the subjects outlined below:     Week 1: Moving & Breathing with Ease  An invitation to explore a felt sense of our own body, we will experience yielding and its relationship to breathing.     Week 2: Building Strength & Support  An overview of basic spinal anatomy to explore how to build support from the ground up. We will focus on the feet as the base of support for standing poses and create an awareness of how to position the pelvis over the legs for optimum transmission of force.     Week 3: Aligning the Spine  Refining the theme of the spine as the central column of support for the body, we will introduce the intention of moving with a calm, quiet spine.     Week 4: Moving from Center  Clarifying our internal pathways, we will explore how to access a felt sense of inner core support and how alignment is an intuitive process.

Week 7: Creating Space with Side Bends  Balancing lateral flexion and rotation in the spine, increasing spinal fluidity, releasing deep intervertebral musculature and differentiating spinal segments to gain length and balance.     Week 8: Coming Home to Yourself  The series culminates with a conscious experience of the breath, ground, gravity, and space. We will explore how the breath moves the body.

Public Works: Art by Elizabeth Olds			Explore the under-told story of Elizabeth Olds (1896–1991), an innovative artist who worked to bring art into the daily lives of more Americans. The first woman to receive the Guggenheim Fellowship for visual arts, Olds became a vital force in the Works Progress Administration and later a celebrated children's book author-illustrator. As a WPA printmaker and educator, she captured the essence of Depression-era America and championed the affordability and accessibility of silkscreen printing. Through her dedication to experimentation, she sought to activate the uniquely democratic possibilities of printmaking and mobilize fine art as an impactful education tool. This exhibition represents the first critically engaged exploration of Olds's extensive body of work, showcasing over 100 prints, paintings, drawings, and illustrations from the 1920s to the 1960s. The exhibition examines Olds's artistic legacy—from her poignant portrayals of labor conditions in American industry, to her satirical social commentary, to her engaging children's books—and underscores the enduring significance of art in everyday life.

Yoga Renewal Series			Join us for a powerful series to kick-off your practice this year! Are you interested in discovering ways to better support yourself during your existing yoga practice or to try yoga for the first time? This 8-week Yoga Renewal Series is perfect for all levels and recommended for anyone who wants to create a stable foundation for a safe and deepened yoga journey!     In this 8-week series, you can expect to learn:  -How to settle your mind and come into your body, breath, and self more deeply. -How to establish and maintain better posture, both on and off the mat, resulting in greater ease, stability and balance, lower stress, greater stability and balance, and fewer aches and pains. -How to move and breathe naturally and organically. -How to prevent injury or strain and promote longevity in any style of yoga. -About your anatomy, and how to adapt your practice to suit your individual needs and wellness goals with optimal results. -To create and establish your personal yoga practice and integrate yoga into your everyday life and way of being.  Supportive reading assignments are given after class for those interested in taking this study deeper at home.     This series, based on the teachings of Donna Farhi, will cover the subjects outlined below:     Week 1: Moving & Breathing with Ease  An invitation to explore a felt sense of our own body, we will experience yielding and its relationship to breathing.     Week 2: Building Strength & Support  An overview of basic spinal anatomy to explore how to build support from the ground up. We will focus on the feet as the base of support for standing poses and create an awareness of how to position the pelvis over the legs for optimum transmission of force.     Week 3: Aligning the Spine  Refining the theme of the spine as the central column of support for the body, we will introduce the intention of moving with a calm, quiet spine.     Week 4: Moving from Center  Clarifying our internal pathways, we will explore how to access a felt sense of inner core support and how alignment is an intuitive process. We will experience how to be moved by the breath as we experiment with basic Sun Salutation, Triangle Pose, Tree Pose and Reclining Big-Toe Pose.     Week 5: Making Friends with Back Bends  Warming, hydrating and releasing the areas of the body that need to be open for ease in back bends, including the chest, shoulders and hips. We will offer key preparatory movements and explore functional spinal extension for lifelong spinal health.     Week 6: Unwinding with Twists & Spirals  Understanding the principle that complex coordinated movement requires more stability, not more mobility, we will experience sound techniques that allow rotational forces to be distributed evenly and safely through the spine, while respecting its natural movement proclivities.     Week 7: Creating Space with Side Bends  Balancing lateral flexion and rotation in the spine, increasing spinal fluidity, releasing deep intervertebral musculature and differentiating spinal segments to gain length and balance.     Week 8: Coming Home to Yourself  The series culminates with a conscious experience of the breath, ground, gravity, and space. We will explore how the breath moves the body.

The Floating World: Masterpieces of Edo Japan			On view at the Blanton through June 30, 2024.     Enjoy more than 130 woodblock prints and painted scrolls from one of history’s most vibrant artistic eras.  After centuries of conflict and war, Japan’s Edo period (1603–1868) was a time of peace, stability, and economic growth. Members of the ruling class patronized artists, merchants, entertainers, and courtesans in major cities like Tokyo (then called Edo), Kyoto, and Osaka. Sharing a visual culture and appreciation for the transient pleasures of life, such diverse groups comingled in a metropolitan melting pot known as ukiyo, or “floating world.” There, a new art genre emerged: Ukiyo-e. These “pictures of the floating world” depict the lifestyle, pleasures, and interests of the urban population— from samurais, geishas, and kabuki actors to boat parties, palaces, and lush landscapes.

Their work endures today as one of the earliest sustained explorations of photography as an artform.  In the fall of 1845 Hill & Adamson prepared an album of their finest work, arranging 109 salted paper prints from their calotype negatives into a folio bound in rich purple leather with intricate gold tooling, and sold it to the prominent English marine painter Clarkson Frederick Stanfield (1793–1867). Now known as the Clarkson Stanfield Album, it is one of only a few such unique albums assembled in the years before Adamson's death at age 26.  More than 175 years later the album is undergoing structural repair, providing the first opportunity since 1845 to view several sections at once before conservators return them to the original binding. The exhibition includes 39 salted paper prints from the Clarkson Stanfield Album, as well as examples of Adamson's earliest photographic trials and two of Hill's painted landscapes. The exhibition is drawn entirely from the Gernsheim Collection, acquired by the Ransom Center in 1963.

Public Works: Art by Elizabeth Olds			Explore the under-told story of Elizabeth Olds (1896–1991), an innovative artist who worked to bring art into the daily lives of more Americans. The first woman to receive the Guggenheim Fellowship for visual arts, Olds became a vital force in the Works Progress Administration and later a celebrated children's book author-illustrator. As a WPA printmaker and educator, she captured the essence of Depression-era America and championed the affordability and accessibility of silkscreen printing. Through her dedication to experimentation, she sought to activate the uniquely democratic possibilities of printmaking and mobilize fine art as an impactful education tool. This exhibition represents the first critically engaged exploration of Olds's extensive body of work, showcasing over 100 prints, paintings, drawings, and illustrations from the 1920s to the 1960s. The exhibition examines Olds's artistic legacy—from her poignant portrayals of labor conditions in American industry, to her satirical social commentary, to her engaging children's books—and underscores the enduring significance of art in everyday life.

SCOTT BALLEW In-Store Performance &amp; Record Signing			Scott Ballew was born in Austin, TX. Year 1983. He didn’t exist when the cosmic cowboy craze glittered its way through town and was an infant when Daniel Johnston was selling cassettes outside of Tower Records on Guadalupe.   At the age of 30, after a blurry decade of making films and commercials in Southern California, Scott returned home to Austin. Inspired by the straightforward and slightly manic music of Michael Hurley and Townes Van Zandt, he first found a creative outlet in the form of films. Of the many projects, perhaps the most pivotal was directing the only documentary about the work of the great artist Terry Allen.   Now 37, he has peeled back another layer to reveal a poetic loner just as lost as the rest of us in this bright and burning futureworld. The songs on Rio Bravo were recorded in an old house in Lockhart, TX in the summer. It sounds like it. Unplug and drift down to 1972. It’s a long drive and something is always close behind.

No Lights No Lycra			If you take away everything that can make going out dancing feel daunting—the needs to rally your friends, to stay out late, to look good, to produce FOMO-inducing content, to deal with strangers, to find parking downtown, to be a "good dancer," to cope with the next day's hangover—if you just got rid of all of that—what you'd be left with is No Lights No Lycra.     Imagine dancing around your bedroom in your PJs, singing into a hairbrush. Now take that same feeling and put it into a dark room with tons of space, your friends, and a sweet sound system. THAT'S what we do here.     NLNL (https://www.nolightsnolycra.com) is a substance-free, judgment-free event that started more than a decade ago in Australia and now happens in more than 50 communities all over the world, including right here in Austin, Texas.     Our resident DJ Brian Blackout and guests play a wide-ranging mix of genres: indie, electropop, synthpop, disco, dusty rock + R&B records, regular funk, future funk, synthwave, new wave, many other waves, and much more. See some of our previous NLNL playlists here: https://www.mixcloud.com/brianblackout/     Follow NLNLATX on Facebook or Instagram for updates on guest DJs and other special occasions.     Here’s what you need to know before your first NLNL:  --It doesn’t matter what you wear. Remember, it’s dark! Gym attire, loungewear—yes, even lycra if that’s what you’re feeling.  --No alcohol, no drugs. No strangers hitting on you. All phones and other glowy devices should be kept silent and in their un-glowy modes once the lights fully go out  --It’s open to all ages. No ticket purchase or RSVP required.  --People often come alone and dance alone (just like in all those songs).  --Bring water—it’s a workout!     Still want to know more?

Yoga Renewal Series			Join us for a powerful series to kick-off your practice this year! Are you interested in discovering ways to better support yourself during your existing yoga practice or to try yoga for the first time? This 8-week Yoga Renewal Series is perfect for all levels and recommended for anyone who wants to create a stable foundation for a safe and deepened yoga journey!     In this 8-week series, you can expect to learn:  -How to settle your mind and come into your body, breath, and self more deeply. -How to establish and maintain better posture, both on and off the mat, resulting in greater ease, stability and balance, lower stress, greater stability and balance, and fewer aches and pains. -How to move and breathe naturally and organically. -How to prevent injury or strain and promote longevity in any style of yoga. -About your anatomy, and how to adapt your practice to suit your individual needs and wellness goals with optimal results. -To create and establish your personal yoga practice and integrate yoga into your everyday life and way of being.  Supportive reading assignments are given after class for those interested in taking this study deeper at home.     This series, based on the teachings of Donna Farhi, will cover the subjects outlined below:     Week 1: Moving & Breathing with Ease  An invitation to explore a felt sense of our own body, we will experience yielding and its relationship to breathing.     Week 2: Building Strength & Support  An overview of basic spinal anatomy to explore how to build support from the ground up. We will focus on the feet as the base of support for standing poses and create an awareness of how to position the pelvis over the legs for optimum transmission of force.     Week 3: Aligning the Spine  Refining the theme of the spine as the central column of support for the body, we will introduce the intention of moving with a calm, quiet spine.     Week 4: Moving from Center  Clarifying our internal pathways, we will explore how to access a felt sense of inner core support and how alignment is an intuitive process. We will experience how to be moved by the breath as we experiment with basic Sun Salutation, Triangle Pose, Tree Pose and Reclining Big-Toe Pose.

Week 7: Creating Space with Side Bends  Balancing lateral flexion and rotation in the spine, increasing spinal fluidity, releasing deep intervertebral musculature and differentiating spinal segments to gain length and balance.     Week 8: Coming Home to Yourself  The series culminates with a conscious experience of the breath, ground, gravity, and space. We will explore how the breath moves the body.

Launching their collaboration in Edinburgh in 1843, the established painter David Octavius Hill (1802–1870) and the young photographer Robert Adamson (1821–1848) combined their aesthetic sensitivity and technical brilliance to produce an unparalleled body of portraits, architectural and landscapes scenes, and pioneering social documents. Their work endures today as one of the earliest sustained explorations of photography as an artform.  In the fall of 1845 Hill & Adamson prepared an album of their finest work, arranging 109 salted paper prints from their calotype negatives into a folio bound in rich purple leather with intricate gold tooling, and sold it to the prominent English marine painter Clarkson Frederick Stanfield (1793–1867). Now known as the Clarkson Stanfield Album, it is one of only a few such unique albums assembled in the years before Adamson's death at age 26.  More than 175 years later the album is undergoing structural repair, providing the first opportunity since 1845 to view several sections at once before conservators return them to the original binding. The exhibition includes 39 salted paper prints from the Clarkson Stanfield Album, as well as examples of Adamson's earliest photographic trials and two of Hill's painted landscapes. The exhibition is drawn entirely from the Gernsheim Collection, acquired by the Ransom Center in 1963.

Public Works: Art by Elizabeth Olds			Explore the under-told story of Elizabeth Olds (1896–1991), an innovative artist who worked to bring art into the daily lives of more Americans. The first woman to receive the Guggenheim Fellowship for visual arts, Olds became a vital force in the Works Progress Administration and later a celebrated children's book author-illustrator. As a WPA printmaker and educator, she captured the essence of Depression-era America and championed the affordability and accessibility of silkscreen printing. Through her dedication to experimentation, she sought to activate the uniquely democratic possibilities of printmaking and mobilize fine art as an impactful education tool. This exhibition represents the first critically engaged exploration of Olds's extensive body of work, showcasing over 100 prints, paintings, drawings, and illustrations from the 1920s to the 1960s. The exhibition examines Olds's artistic legacy—from her poignant portrayals of labor conditions in American industry, to her satirical social commentary, to her engaging children's books—and underscores the enduring significance of art in everyday life.

Long before Dorothy arrives, there is another young woman, born with emerald-green skin—smart, fiery, misunderstood, and possessing an extraordinary talent.
